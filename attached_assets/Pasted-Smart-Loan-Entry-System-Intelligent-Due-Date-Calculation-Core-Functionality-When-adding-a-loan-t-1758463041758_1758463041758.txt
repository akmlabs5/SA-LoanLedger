Smart Loan Entry System
Intelligent Due Date Calculation
Core Functionality: When adding a loan, the system should provide smart term selection options that automatically calculate due dates based on the loan start date.
Term Options Required:
•30 Days (1-Month term)
•60 Days (2-Month term)
•90 Days (3-Month term)
•180 Days (6-Month term)
•360 Days (12-Month term)
Smart Behavior:
•User selects loan start date
•System presents term options showing calculated due dates for each option
•Automatic adjustment for weekends and holidays to ensure due dates fall on business days
•Clear display of what the due date will be for each term option before user confirms
SIBOR Rate Matching System
Intelligent Rate Selection: The system should automatically match the appropriate SIBOR rate based on the selected loan term:
SIBOR Term Mapping:
•30 Days → 1-Month SIBOR
•60 Days → 2-Month SIBOR
•90 Days → 3-Month SIBOR
•180 Days → 6-Month SIBOR
•360 Days → 12-Month SIBOR
Or other custom if the user wanted
The goal is to also use this information to track the SIBOR Rates in the system for example have a trend of 6 months SIBOR rate. 

Rate Display Logic:
•Automatically populate the appropriate SIBOR rate based on term selection
•Allow manual override if needed for special circumstances
•Display total rate calculation: SIBOR + Bank Margin (from facility setup)
•Show real-time interest cost preview as user makes selections
Business Day Intelligence
Saudi Business Calendar Integration: The system must account for Saudi Arabia's unique business calendar:
Weekend Handling:
•Saudi weekends are Friday-Saturday (not Saturday-Sunday)
•Automatically adjust due dates to avoid weekends
•Move dates to the next business day (Sunday) when needed
Holiday Management: Due dates should automatically avoid Saudi banking holidays and move to the next business day.
