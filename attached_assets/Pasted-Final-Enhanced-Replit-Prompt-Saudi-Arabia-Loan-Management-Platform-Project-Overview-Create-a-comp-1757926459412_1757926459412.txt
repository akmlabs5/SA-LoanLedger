Final Enhanced Replit Prompt: Saudi Arabia Loan Management Platform
Project Overview
Create a comprehensive, mobile-friendly loan management platform specifically designed for the Saudi Arabian market with intelligent Rules-Based AI insights. This borrower-centric system transforms an existing Excel-based loan tracking workflow into a modern web application with automated decision-support, intelligent notifications, and proactive portfolio management capabilities. The platform should be user-friendly, cost-effective, and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

Budget Consideration: Target cost-effective solutions within reasonable budget constraints, prioritizing open-source technologies and efficient API integrations.

Core Business Requirements
Saudi Market Specifications

•	Banking Integration: Dropdown selection from all major Saudi banks, prioritizing:
◦	Arab National Bank (ANB)
◦	Saudi British Bank (SABB) 
◦	Al Rajhi Bank (ARB)
◦	Saudi National Bank (SNB)
◦	Riyad Bank
◦	Banque Saudi Fransi (BSF)
◦	Alinma Bank

•	Mobile-Responsive: Optimized interface inspired by Robinhood's mobile excellence for seamless desktop and mobile access

Rules-Based AI Intelligence System
1. Portfolio Risk Concentration Alert
Automated Rule: Triggers when single bank exposure exceeds user-defined threshold (example: 40% of total portfolio)

Dashboard Display Example:
⚠️ CONCENTRATION RISK DETECTED
[Bank Name] represents [X]% of your total exposure ([Amount] SAR of [Total] SAR total portfolio). 
Consider diversifying across additional banks to reduce concentration risk.
 
Recommendation: Target maximum [X]% exposure per bank
Action: Explore facilities with [Alternative Banks]

2. LTV Threshold Breach Warning
Automated Rule: Triggers when LTV ratios exceed user-configurable thresholds (example: LTV on Outstanding > 75% OR LTV on Limit > 90%)

Dashboard Display Example:
🔴 LTV LIMIT EXCEEDED
[Bank] Facility: Current LTV on Outstanding = [X]% (Target: <[Y]%)
Outstanding: [Amount] SAR | Collateral Value: [Amount] SAR
 
Immediate Action Required:
- Reduce outstanding by [Amount] SAR, OR
- Provide additional collateral worth [Amount] SAR
Risk: Potential margin call or facility review

3. Cash Flow Optimization Insight
Automated Rule: Identifies refinancing opportunities when loans due within specified timeframe exceed available credit AND SIBOR is trending upward

Dashboard Display Example:
💡 STRATEGIC REFINANCING OPPORTUNITY
[Amount] SAR due in next [X] days with SIBOR trending upward (+[X]% this month)
Current weighted average rate: SIBOR + [X]%
 
Opportunity: Lock in current rates before further increases
Savings Potential: [Amount] SAR annually if rates rise [X]%
Action: Contact relationship managers for term loan conversion

4. Payment Schedule Optimization Alert
Automated Rule: Warns when multiple loans due same week exceed user-defined percentage of monthly cash flow

Dashboard Display Example:
📊 CASH FLOW BOTTLENECK DETECTED
Week of [Date Range]: [Amount] SAR due across [X] loans ([Bank]: [Amount], [Bank]: [Amount])
This represents [X]% of your typical monthly cash flow
 
Risk: Potential liquidity strain
Solutions:
1. Negotiate staggered payment dates
2. Utilize revolving facilities for temporary bridge
3. Consider early payment of smaller loans to reduce concentration

5. Interest Rate Arbitrage Opportunity
Automated Rule: Identifies when rate differential between banks exceeds user-defined threshold with available credit

Dashboard Display Example:
💰 INTEREST RATE ARBITRAGE DETECTED
Rate Differential Opportunity:
- [Bank A]: SIBOR + [X]% (Available: [Amount] SAR)
- Current [Bank B] Loan: SIBOR + [Y]% (Outstanding: [Amount] SAR)
 
Potential Savings: [Amount] SAR annually ([X]% on [Amount] SAR)
Action: Consider refinancing [Bank B] loan with [Bank A] facility
Payback Period: [Timeframe] ([conditions])
