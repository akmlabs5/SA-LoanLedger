## Launch Day Steps

### 1. Domain & SSL Verification
```bash
# Check SSL certificate status
curl -I https://akm-labs.com

# Expected: 200 OK with security headers
# If "not private" warning: Wait for SSL provisioning (15-60 min)
```

### 2. Run Smoke Tests
```bash
# Run comprehensive security tests
./smoke-test.sh

# All tests must show: ‚úÖ (green checkmark)
# Fix any ‚ùå (red X) before proceeding
```

### 3. Test Core Functionality
- [ ] User signup with email verification
- [ ] Login with 2FA (if enabled)
- [ ] Create organization
- [ ] Invite team member
- [ ] Create bank and facility
- [ ] Create loan with SIBOR calculation
- [ ] Add collateral and guarantee
- [ ] Upload documents
- [ ] Test AI chat (both green and blue buttons)
- [ ] Generate PDF/Excel reports
- [ ] Test email notifications
- [ ] Verify mobile UI on actual devices

### 4. Start Production Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor logs in real-time
tail -f /var/log/production.log | ./monitor-logs.sh

# Watch for:
# üî¥ Errors (require immediate attention)
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings (investigate soon)
# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info (normal operations)
```

### 5. Performance Check
- [ ] Dashboard loads < 2 seconds
- [ ] API responses < 500ms
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] No N+1 query issues
- [ ] Frontend bundle size reasonable

---

## First Hour Monitoring

### Critical Metrics to Watch
1. **HTTPS Redirects**: Should see `üîí HTTPS redirect` logs
2. **x-forwarded-proto**: Should NOT see `‚ö†Ô∏è Missing x-forwarded-proto` warnings
3. **Database**: Connection stable, no timeout errors
4. **API Errors**: No 5xx errors in logs
5. **Email Delivery**: SendGrid requests successful

### Run Smoke Tests Hourly
```bash
# Run every hour for first 6 hours
*/60 * * * * /path/to/smoke-test.sh
```

### Alert Triggers
- Any üî¥ **ERROR** in log monitor ‚Üí Investigate immediately
- More than 10 ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING** per minute ‚Üí Check patterns
- Smoke test failures ‚Üí Roll back if critical

---

## Daily Operations

### Morning Checklist
- [ ] Run smoke tests: `./smoke-test.sh`
- [ ] Check error count from previous day
- [ ] Review any email delivery failures
- [ ] Verify database backups completed
- [ ] Check SSL certificate expiry (90 days)

### Weekly Checklist
- [ ] Review log monitor summary
- [ ] Update smoke test patterns (if needed)
- [ ] Check for dependency updates
- [ ] Review SendGrid usage/quotas
- [ ] Verify domain authentication status

### Monthly Checklist

```

### 2. Rollback Triggers
