# Overview

This platform is a full-stack loan management system tailored for the Saudi Arabian market, integrating SIBOR-based calculations and AI-driven insights. It helps users manage loan portfolios by providing tools for risk management, concentration alerts, and LTV monitoring. The system handles bank facilities, collateral tracking, and the full loan lifecycle, all within a mobile-responsive design. Its core purpose is to offer intelligent insights for financial portfolio optimization, specifically targeting the unique requirements of the Saudi banking sector.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side is a React TypeScript single-page application, using Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for state management, and Shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI) for components. Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS with a Saudi-themed color scheme and mobile-first design. Forms use React Hook Form with Zod validation, and Recharts is used for data visualization.

## Backend Architecture
The server is built with Express.js, utilizing Drizzle ORM with Neon (PostgreSQL) for type-safe database operations. Authentication is managed via Replit Auth (OpenID Connect) and Passport.js, with PostgreSQL-backed sessions. It follows a REST API pattern, organizing endpoints by resource, and includes a storage abstraction layer for maintainability.

## AI Intelligence System
The platform incorporates a rules-based AI for intelligent insights, including portfolio risk analysis (bank concentration, LTV monitoring), and email notifications for loan due dates via SendGrid. It integrates with DeepSeek API for advanced insights and operates on user-configurable thresholds to provide actionable recommendations. Key AI features include a Smart Loan Matcher, What-If Scenario Analysis, a Natural Language Query System, Auto-Categorized Daily Alerts, and the ability to attach files to AI chat for context enrichment.

## Data Storage Architecture
The database schema is designed for the Saudi banking context, storing information on Banks (pre-populated), Facilities, Loans (with SIBOR calculations), Collateral (with valuation history), Users (via Replit Auth), and Sessions. It uses UUID primary keys and proper foreign key relationships.

## Mobile-First Design
The application is optimized for mobile devices with responsive breakpoints, touch-friendly elements, mobile-specific navigation, and optimized form layouts, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

## Admin Portal
A separate, isolated admin portal with its own authentication system provides system stats, user management, and maintenance controls. It features a 3D animated authentication interface and robust security architecture.
